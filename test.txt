Silicon Valley is usually measured on its innovation, whiz kids, products and profits. 
Now, in a rare turnabout, it is about to be judged on its behaviour.
The very distinguished venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which nurtured such
famous Internet start-ups as Google and Amazon, has been on trial here for the last month.
Ellen Pao, a former junior partner at Kleiner, says it discriminated against her and fired her.
Sheryl Sandberg’s book: Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead is about the
conundrum that women face at the work place and what it takes for a woman to succeed
and lead in the modern work world and in many ways the support that women require to
succeed in what has predominantly seen as a man’s world.
