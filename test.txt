Look into my eyes try to see what I know
A twisted little journey through the path of psycho
A vivid premonition manifesting undigesting
The petty little trifles taught to adolescents condescending
I'm digressing
A complicated girl with very simple wishes
A global rocket has your people sleeping with the fishes
And when your city comes to desolation
One small step and I reach global incineration
I'm not normal and I don't pretend so
My approach is pretty much a bomb crescendo
Reality is false and its so cause i say
Chaotic demolition well that's just my forte
Death is a fun way to pass the time though
Several little bullets moving in staccato
The terror of my rain will live on in infamy
Singing when they die like a dead man's symphony
Yo it's the rat with the flat hat
I'm hip to you house cats
Can't fool me grab the cheese from the mouse trap
